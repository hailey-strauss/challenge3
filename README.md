# <Challenge-3-Password-Generator>

## Description

For this project I made a password generator. This password generator creats prompts for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. These prompts allowed users to specify the criteria for their desired password. Based on the specified criteria, my program generated a randomized password. It is combined the selected character types in a random order to create a secure and unique password. Implemented a mechanism to handle incorrect input. If the user provided invalid information or missed any required criteria, your program displayed a notification or message to inform them about the error. After successfully generating the password, it's displayed under the "Generate a Passcode" section. This way, users could easily see and copy their newly generated password.
